# Power BI Dashboard for Flight Operations Analysis

## Overview
This project features a **responsive Power BI dashboard** designed for analyzing flight operations, including patterns, cancellations, and delays. The dashboard presents key insights through **interactive visualizations**, helping users monitor **flight status, performance, and cancellation reasons** efficiently.

## Features
- **Flight Patterns Analysis**: Identify trends in departures, arrivals, and peak travel times.
- **Cancellations & Delays Insights**: Visualize the reasons behind flight cancellations and delays.
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor key flight performance indicators.
- **Interactive Visuals**: Drill down into specific flights, airlines, and airports.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes and devices.

## Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For calculated measures and custom KPIs.
- **SQL/Python (if applicable)**: For data preprocessing and transformation.
- **Excel/CSV**: For data sources (if used).

## Installation & Usage
1. **Ensure Power BI Desktop is installed**: [Download Here](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/)
2. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/powerbi-flight-dashboard.git
   ```
3. Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
4. Refresh data sources and adjust parameters as needed.
5. Publish to Power BI Service for web access.

## Data Sources
- **Airline Data**: Flight status, departure & arrival times, delays, etc.
- **Weather Data (if applicable)**: External data affecting delays and cancellations.

## Future Improvements
- Add **machine learning models** to predict flight delays.
- Enhance **real-time data integration**.
- Improve **user experience** with additional filters and slicers.
